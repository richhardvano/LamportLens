**What decision would this feature inform**

Describe the situation where you would use it. "I want to know X so I can
decide Y" is more useful than a field name.

**Proposed behavior**

**Does it change the arithmetic or the contract**

- [ ] New report field only (additive, no rule change)
- [ ] Changes a rule or an aggregate (requires both engines and parity)
- [ ] Changes the input format
- [ ] Changes the default rate (requires a changelog entry and a note in docs/RATE_SCHEDULE.md)

**Would you run both implementations, or Python only**

The two implementations are kept at parity on purpose. If this feature only
lands in one of them, say so explicitly so the trade-off is on the record.
